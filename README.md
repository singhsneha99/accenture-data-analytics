# Accenture Data Analyst Simulation Project

This repository showcases a project completed as part of a Data Analytics & Visualization job simulation on the Forage platform, focused on advising a hypothetical social media client. The project was aimed at understanding what it might be like to participate in a typical project team at Accenture while utilizing Excel and data analytics and visualization skills in a realistic context.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Analysis**: Seven datasets were thoroughly cleaned, modeled, and analyzed to uncover valuable insights into content trends. This process involved identifying patterns and trends within the data to inform strategic decisions.

- **Insightful Communication**: To effectively communicate the key findings, a PowerPoint deck and a video presentation were prepared. These materials were designed to present the insights to both the hypothetical client and internal stakeholders.

## Why I'm Interested

Participating in this simulation provided valuable insights into the role of a Data Analyst at Accenture. It allowed me to experience the dynamic nature of working within a project team and applying data analytics and visualization skills to real-world scenarios.

I found a genuine interest in the process of cleaning, modeling, and analyzing client data to derive meaningful insights. Additionally, creating slides to effectively communicate these findings and presenting insights back to the client resonated with me.

I am excited about the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills I've gained through this simulation in a collaborative and diverse project team at a reputable company like Accenture.
